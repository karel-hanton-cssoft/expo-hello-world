Context
- Small household teams, lightweight sharing (like Settle Up). Users should be able to create tasks, assign them to members, nest tasks and track progress.

Task
1. Create 6 short user stories (persona + goal + acceptance) covering: create, assign, mark done, nested tasks, plan completion, group share.
2. For each story define expected API calls and UI interactions (eg. Create task => POST /api/tasks with payload). Keep responses simple.

Output
- A Markdown list of user stories and small sequence diagrams (textual) for interactions.

Acceptance criteria
- Stories cover the main app flows. Clear mapping to endpoints and minimal UI components required for each.
